**Two Internet Protocols** that govern how the data transfer between routers.
1. **TCP**
  - services identifiers
  - 80 for HTTP
  - 443 for HTTPS (Secure means Encrypted)
  - *Fragmentation*: Files are send in fragment
  - it ensures all data are being sent in intact mode or no data is being sent
2. **IP**: IP-address
  - #.#.#.#, each # has 256 possibilities

**Domain Name System (DNS)** translate domain names into IP address.

**HTTP** is the protocols that tell how the internet browser and internet server inter-communicate with each other.

**GET** and **POST**
1. **GET** means put any user input into the **URL**
2. **HIDE** means do not put it

**Browser** *requests* information from the **server**, and **server** *response* to your **browser**.
