### Lecture 0 (CS50: Introduction to Computer Science)

- **Computer Science** is about problem solving. Computer represents number in **binary digits**. We add each *bits* or so called one unit to represents more numbers.

- **Numbers** will be represented by **letters** with a standard, and file format.

- **ASCII** keys maps "A" into "65".

- **8 bits** is a **byte**.

- You can represents 255 characters. (2^8)

- **Unicode** maps more characters using 8-bits and 16-bits or 32-bits or 64-bits. (with increasing characters to store)

- **RGB** is represented by **72, 75, 84**.

- each dots use 8x3=24 bits (RGB) to form an image.

- **Algorithm** is step by step instruction to solve problems.
